Since its premiere, Interstellar gained a cult following,[5] and now is regarded by many sci-fi experts as one of the best science-fiction films of all time.\nInterstellar was nominated for five awards at the 87th Academy Awards, winning Best Visual Effects, and received numerous other accolades\"\"\"\n\n# Split into a list of sentences\ntexts = text.split('.')\n\n# Clean up to remove empty
